/**
 * One-shot backfill: seed the reader's scheduler from the retired Miniflux
 * instance's own scheduling state.
 *
 * The old supervisor wrote `feeds.next_check_at` into Miniflux's Postgres on a
 * 1-minute loop — those values ARE the learned bell data. Without this backfill
 * the reader's fresh scheduler sees every feed as "never scheduled" and drains
 * the entire backlog in one burst instead of resuming the established schedule
 * (the old targets are spread across the day; most are still in the future).
 *
 * The old target also becomes `fetch_after_at`, the not-before floor, until the
 * feed's first fetch: that keeps a `Retry-After` the old scheduler had already
 * honoured from being eroded by a freshly computed bell. The next fetch
 * overwrites the floor from the response, as usual.
 *
 * Matching is by `feed_url` (the import's natural key). Unmatched feeds — URL
 * variants, or feeds dropped by the account surgery — simply plan their own
 * target on the first tick, which is exactly the old behaviour for a new feed.
 *
 * Standalone on purpose (bun:sqlite only, no app imports) so the same script
 * runs against a local file and inside the deployed container:
 *
 *   local: bun run scripts/backport-schedule.ts payload.json [dbPath]
 *   prod:  cat payload.json | uc -c homelab-spfy exec -T miniflux-frontend -- \
 *            sh -c 'cat > /tmp/backfill.ts && bun /tmp/backfill.ts'
 *          (payload on stdin; DB path from READER_DB_PATH)

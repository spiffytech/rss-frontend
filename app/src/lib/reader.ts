/**
 * Reader state, per page render.
 *
 * Three mechanisms, and nothing else:
 *
 *  - **The list is a projection**, so the first document arrives with rows (the
 *    server awaits the read) and a write can be applied optimistically.
 *  - **Paging only appends.** The derive receives the rows already on screen and
 *    asks for the missing page; `refresh` therefore never disturbs what you are
 *    reading, and a row you have read cannot vanish from under you.
 *  - **A write applies the server's copy of the rows it touched.** `setStatus`
 *    answers with them, so a mark-read costs no re-read of the window — no
 *    dirty-id bookkeeping, no reconciliation pass.

 * The route tree. Declared here rather than derived from filenames: one file to
 * read when you want to know what URLs exist.
 *
 * The reading view's whole identity (feed, category, starred, search) lives in
 * its query string, so `/` is the only reader route. The old app's `/feed/:id`
 * and `/search?q=` shapes are handled with real redirects in middleware, and
 * unknown paths are redirected there too — the NotFound route only catches what
 * a client-side navigation can produce.

/**
 * Pure feed-scheduling model. No I/O — everything here is unit-testable.
 *
 * Ported verbatim from the validated reference implementation
 * (src/server/lib/schedule/model.ts of the retired Miniflux-supervisor app,
 * itself ported from playground/scripts/poll-sim.ts). Two deltas, both because
 * this app IS the fetcher and the only writer of `next_check_at`:
 *
 * - `decodeCacheHintMinutes` / `entryFrequencyIntervalMinutes` are GONE. They
 *   existed to recover a cache hint Miniflux had folded into `next_check_at`.
 *   Here the fetcher reads `Retry-After` / `Cache-Control` / `Expires` itself,
 *   so the hint is exact data applied as a floor — which also closes the old
 *   doc's "short cache hints are unrecoverable" limitation.
 * - Feed ids are UUID strings, so the per-feed jitter hash is FNV-1a over the
 *   id string (UUIDv7 ids share a time prefix; hashing the id itself would
 *   correlate neighbours).
 *
 * Times of day are UTC minutes 0..1439; days are UTC epoch-day numbers.

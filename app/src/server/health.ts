/**
 * Health payloads, kept separate from the route so they can be asserted without
 * a database or a running scheduler.
 *
 * Two questions, two URLs — because they have different answers:
 *
 *   /health            "should this container be restarted?"  503 only when the
 *                      process cannot reach its database.
 *   /health/scheduler  "is the poller keeping up?"            503 when the last
 *                      completed tick is stale or absent.
 *
 * A stale tick is *not* a reason to restart: a restart interrupts the very work
 * that is behind, and a cold first tick on a large database legitimately takes
 * minutes. So the liveness endpoint reports the scheduler in its body (and a
 * `degraded` flag) while still answering 200.
